Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data
======================

Course Project
--------------

Run run_analysis.R.  The script will look for the downloaded zipfile in the
current working directory.  If the zipfile does not exist, it will attempt to
redownload the zip file.  If the expanded folder _UCI HAR Dataset_ does not
already exist the script will then upzip the zipfile in the current working
directory.  The script will load the appropriate datafiles from the dataset
process the files.  See additional code comments in run_analysis.R for details.
Script will output a "cleaned" file clean_data.txt.
